      <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-muted">
        I build operating workflows that keep teams responsive without blowing
        up day-to-day execution. My work sits at the intersection of operations,
        revenue, and engineering, and I like being close to the details.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
        Outside of work, I have been with my fiancée for over five years, we
        have a two-year-old son, two dogs, a cat, and a ferret. I spend my time
        making and playing music, running, and being with my family.

          I do best in environments where scale, accountability, and speed all
          matter. I work across leadership and delivery teams and keep the
          execution honest.
