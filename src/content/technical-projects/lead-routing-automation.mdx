  - "Existing CRM data quality issues"
  - "Required auditability for compliance and leadership reporting"
stack:
  - "C# / .NET services"
  - "JavaScript frontend"
  - "PostgreSQL"
  - "CRM integrations"
decisions:
  - "Built rule-based routing with explicit ownership"
  - "Added SLA timers and exception queues"
  - "Designed for easy policy updates without code changes"
tradeoffs:
  - "Used rules over ML for transparency and auditability"
  - "Accepted slower initial routing setup to enable clear ownership"
outcome: "Clearer ownership and a consistent routing workflow for lead follow-up."
