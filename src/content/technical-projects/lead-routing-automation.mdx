title: "Lead routing automation"
summary: "Automated intake, routing, and SLA enforcement so inbound requests reached the right owner fast."
why: "Manual routing created delays, inconsistent follow-up, and low trust in SLA reporting."
constraints:
  - "GTM teams needed clear ownership and escalation rules"
  - "Existing CRM data quality issues and inconsistent fields"
  - "Required auditability for compliance and leadership reporting"
stack:
  - "C# / .NET services"
  - "JavaScript admin UI"
  - "PostgreSQL"
  - "CRM integrations + audit logging"
decisions:
  - "Built rule-based routing with explicit ownership"
  - "Added SLA timers, escalation paths, and exception queues"
  - "Designed for easy policy updates without code changes"
tradeoffs:
  - "Used rules over ML for transparency and auditability"
  - "Accepted slower initial routing setup to enable clear ownership"
outcome: "Clearer ownership, faster response time, and consistent routing behavior."
order: 2
