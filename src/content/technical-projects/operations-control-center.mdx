title: "Operations control center"
summary: "Built an internal control center for field capacity, job status, and execution risk."
why: "Leaders needed a single view of operational health without stitching together spreadsheets."
constraints:
  - "Field data arrived at different times and quality levels"
  - "Updates needed to feel current without heavy infrastructure"
  - "Minimal training time for operations teams"
stack:
  - "C# / .NET"
  - "PostgreSQL"
  - "JavaScript dashboard UI"
  - "Scheduled data sync"
decisions:
  - "Focused on 3-5 core operational metrics"
  - "Built exceptions-first views instead of full reports"
  - "Added lightweight exports for executive reporting"
tradeoffs:
  - "Kept the dashboard narrow to preserve adoption"
  - "Used scheduled sync over real-time streaming to reduce complexity"
outcome: "Consolidated visibility with clearer risk signals and faster intervention."
