## Context (business problem)
Kansas Electric needed a modern, credible digital presence and internal systems to keep pace with growth. The website, lead capture, and internal workflows were not connected, which slowed response times and obscured pipeline health.

{/* This is where I show the real ops pain, not marketing fluff */}
## Constraints
- Small team, limited engineering bandwidth
- Field work with variable schedules and data quality
- Legacy processes and tools spread across email, spreadsheets, and ad-hoc systems
- Needed to deliver improvements without disrupting day-to-day operations

## What I built (technical + operational)
- Rebuilt the public website with clear service positioning and lead capture
- Implemented intake routing so new requests reached the right teams fast
- Built a suite of PWAs and Apps Script tools for estimating, field reporting, and planning
- Connected operational data so pipeline status, capacity, and follow-up were visible
- Documented operating workflows and ownership to keep execution consistent

## Highlights
- Faster estimating from intake to structured take-off
- Cleaner field reporting with offline capture and standardization
- Shared visibility across pipeline, scheduling, and labor
